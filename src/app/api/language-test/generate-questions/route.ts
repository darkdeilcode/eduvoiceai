    IMPORTANT: Create questions that work well for AI video conversations where the AI examiner will ask questions and the student will respond via video.
    
    Generate exactly 6 questions following this structure:
    
    **Part 1 (Introduction & Interview) - 3 questions (4-5 minutes total):**
    - Personal topics: home, family, work/study, hobbies, daily routine
    - Each question should have 2-3 natural follow-up questions
    - Time limit: 60-90 seconds per question
    
    **Part 2 (Individual Long Turn) - 1 question (3-4 minutes):**
    - Cue card format with clear bullet points
    - Include: "You should say:" followed by 3-4 specific points
    - Add: "and explain why/how..." at the end
    - Time limit: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
    - Include 1-2 follow-up questions
    
    **Part 3 (Two-way Discussion) - 2 questions (4-5 minutes):**
    - Abstract topics related to Part 2 theme
    - More complex, analytical questions
    - Each question should have 1-2 follow-up questions
    - Time limit: 120-150 seconds per question
    
    **Difficulty Guidelines:**
    - Beginner: Simple vocabulary, present tense focus, concrete topics
    - Intermediate: Mixed tenses, some abstract concepts, comparison questions
    - Advanced: Complex structures, abstract thinking, hypothetical situations
    
    **Language Code Consideration:**
    Use language code ${languageCode} to ensure cultural relevance and appropriate examples.
